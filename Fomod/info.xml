Dev change log:

	v 25-12-2016
fix "milkgen based on maid level" not producing milk at level 0

fix for milkgen formula

	v 07-11-2016
added mcm toggle for maid milkgen based on maid level(so now its base milkgen*maidlvl), its off by default since its probably huge boost at latter levels.
changed fixed x0.5 milk generation reduction to level based, so at lvl 0 its quite easy to stop producing milk, but at lvl 10+... well good-luck trying, especially if you play with my skoomawhore patch
added a way out of being milkmaid, if actor is lv 0 maid, have less than 1 milk and produces no milk, its leveling stats will be reset
added progression block, actor must have more than 0 lactacid in order to increase maidlevel, so at lvl 0 actor can probably be considered still a human, but its easy to step over on a path of becoming cowgirl

added soundless lactacid feeding potion to milkpumps

disabled make milkmaid messagebox promt if player has no free maid slots
npcs( not maids or slaves) that use pumps(if they finish using it/stand up and do something else) get 1-2 milk, pregnant npcs get x2 milk

	v 17-06-2016
