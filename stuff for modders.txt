Compiling mod scripts and using CK requires extracted scripts from soft-linked mods. For easier compiling install all plugins as "False", that way you wont need their sources

Mod sends out "MME_MilkCycleComplete" event after script passes through all milkmaids adding milk

Mod listens to events:
RegisterForModEvent("MME_AddMilkMaid", "onMME_AddMilkMaid") - makes target a Milkmaid, send by external mod
RegisterForModEvent("MME_AddMilkSlave", "onMME_AddMilkSlave") - makes target(NOT PLAYER) a MilkSlave, send by external mod
RegisterForModEvent("MME_Milking", "onMME_Milking") - initiates milking cycle by external mod
RegisterForModEvent("SlaveToggle",   "OnSlaveToggle") - toggles actor slave mode, adds actor to milkslave faction

SexLab:
RegisterForModEvent("OrgasmStart", "OnSexLabOrgasm") - applies Lactation effects to milk maids during orgasm if they have 1 milk and reduces their milk by 1, if animation has tag "Masturbation", adds cum/semen potion
RegisterForModEvent("AnimationStart", "OnSexLabStart") - initiates milking cycle if "3J Straight Breastfeeding" or "3J Lesbian Breastfeeding" animation played on milkmaid
RegisterForModEvent("StageStart", "OnSexLabStart") - initiates milking cycle if "3J Straight Breastfeeding" or "3J Lesbian Breastfeeding" animation played on milkmaid, this one is used if player have foreplay enabled in sexlab

Example:
;Send Add Milkmaid Event
int MME_AddMilkMaid = ModEvent.Create("MME_AddMilkMaid")
ModEvent.PushForm(MME_AddMilkMaid, akSpeaker/akTarget)
ModEvent.Send(MME_AddMilkMaid)
RegisterForModEvent("SlaveToggle",   "OnSlaveToggle") - toggles actor slave mode, add actor to milkslave faction

;Send SlaveToggle Event *untested		this event adds/removes actor from milkslave faction and toggles IsSlave variable, can be used to restrict player milking, see below
int MME_SlaveToggle = ModEvent.Create("MME_SlaveToggle")
ModEvent.PushForm(MME_SlaveToggle, akSpeaker/akTarget)
ModEvent.Send(MME_SlaveToggle)

;Send Add MilkSlave Event (NOT PLAYER) *untested 
int MME_AddMilkSlave = ModEvent.Create("MME_AddMilkSlave")
ModEvent.PushForm(MME_AddMilkSlave, akSpeaker/akTarget, Level, Milk) 
ModEvent.Send(MME_AddMilkSlave)

;Add Milkmaid Event received by MME

	actor akActor = Sender as Actor
	if MilkQ.MILKmaid.find(akActor) != -1	;Check if target is already milkmaid
		MilkQ.AssignSlot(akActor)			;make target milkmaid
	else 
		Notification( "Target already milkmaid" )
	endif
EndEvent

;Send Milking Event

    int handle = ModEvent.Create("MME_Milking")
    if (handle)
        ModEvent.PushForm(handle, akActor) ;Actor
        ModEvent.PushInt(handle, 4) ;Milking Mode, should probably leave at 4
        ModEvent.PushInt(handle, 0) ;MilkingType, 0 or 1
        ModEvent.Send(handle)

Milking and slave configuration:
milking equipment ( auto/manual milking options, [s]optional lactacid injection[/s]; container for milk to be given to master; type, qty if player leaves enslavement, milk will be given during next milking at milkpump or can be sold)
-UnsetFloatValue(MILKmaid[i],"MME.MilkMaid.MilkingContainerCumsSUM") - total number of cum in "container"
-UnsetFloatValue(MILKmaid[i],"MME.MilkMaid.MilkingContainerMilksSUM") - total number of milks in "container", since its all mixed, you wont get race milks(unless you are using simple milks)
-UnsetFloatValue(MILKmaid[i],"MME.MilkMaid.MilkingContainerLactacid") - lactacid injection(this one is set by master, uses 1 int per hour)
-UnsetIntValue(MILKmaid[i],"MME.MilkMaid.MilkingMode") - milking mode auto(2)/off(1)/manual(0)*default, if actor is slave and mode is not 0, milking by hotkey is disabled, auto milking will happen every hour if actor have at least 1 milk
-UnsetIntValue(MILKmaid[i],"MME.MilkMaid.IsSlave") - actor is a slave = 1, slave frameworks mod authors should set this and above to desired value to disable/enable milking and obviously revert after slavery end, it is also would be nice to add actor to milkslavefaction, in case of player that would prevent milking dialogue
